            <p>The image on the top left of this page is the hybrid Gorilla-Elephant(Gorilla-Elo) who are one of the two Apex Predator species on earth who hunt every single living being on this planet regardless of their status on the food cycle. The word is that these two animals morphed from a failed lab experiment 7 years ago. For the time being we have not much understanding on how it functions. We do know that their main weekness is water as they don't come near the coast so thats where we live then. We still have to go into the midlands often to gather supplies and they have attacked us multiple times resulting in many of our soldiers losing their lives. </p>

            <p> The image on the bottom left is the second type of Apex Predator species which is a hybrid of an Elephant and a Gorilla known as the Elo-Gorilla. The Elo-Gorilla's weaknesses are the same as the Gorilla-Elo's as they can't handle water at all. For both Alpha's if they come into contact with Water their skins will burn. But you will need a Niagara falls amount of water to fully finish them off. </p>
